# Bootstrap-Portfolio

<!-- 

Welcome to my second take of this website. This website is designed, utilizing Bootstrap and responsive imagery properties, to be more responsive than just the basic HTML and CSS website.

To see what I mean in action, try it yourself! Drag the browser around on this bad boy and hopefully (unless I missed something, which is plausible), all the content should shift accordingly.
